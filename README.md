# Fizz-Buzz
1 Create a function that lists all numbers between 1 - 1000;

1 but instead of printing the numbers that are evenly divisible by 3, print "fizz";

1 and instead of printing the numbers that are evenly divisible by 5, print "buzz";

1 also, if the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzBuzz".

You'll need a few things from your past pre-lessons:

1 % modulus

1 while loop

1 ++ incrementor

1 And something you have covered in depth yet: if(){} if else(){} else {}
